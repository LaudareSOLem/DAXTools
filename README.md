# DAXTools
This module is for all my fellow Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3 admins. I know you're still out there, and I know you're hurting.

## Introduction
DAXTools is a PowerShell module for administration and automation of my favorite legacy software, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3.
I am currently in the process of refurbishing all the PowerShell scripts I've written out of frustration over DAX2012R3s poor automation capabilities.
If you're tired of doing the same old administrative tasks in your or your customers Dynamics AX 2012 environments, this module might be for you.

## Instructions

1. Download and put in an appropriate PS module path
2. RTFM
3. Jolly automation \[T]/
